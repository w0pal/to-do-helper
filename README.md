# 🍅 Pomodoro To-Do Helper

## Application Inspiration

This application is inspired by my personal experience as someone with ADHD tendencies who often struggles to focus on tasks. I frequently feel overwhelmed when looking at long task lists and don't know where to start.

The Pomodoro Technique has helped me break down large tasks into smaller, more manageable sessions. Combined with lofi music and a point system, it makes the learning and working process more enjoyable and motivating. This application was created with the hope of helping people with similar conditions stay productive and motivated.

## Main Features

- ✅ **Task Management**: Add, delete, and manage tasks with difficulty levels
- 🍅 **Pomodoro Timer**: 25-minute timer with visual countdown and progress bar
- 🎵 **Music Integration**: Automatically opens YouTube for lofi music when session starts
- 🏆 **Points & Level System**: Gamification with points and levels for motivation
- 📊 **Detailed Statistics**: Focus tracking, session count, and achievements
- 💾 **JSON Storage**: All data automatically saved in JSON format
- 🎯 **ADHD-Friendly**: Special design to help people with attention deficit

## OOP Structure

### Classes & Inheritance
- `BaseTask` (Abstract Class) - Base class for all task types
- `Task` (extends BaseTask) - Regular task implementation
- `PomodoroTask` (extends Task) - Task with enhanced Pomodoro features
- `TaskManager` - Manages all task operations and data persistence
- `PomodoroSession` - Handler for Pomodoro sessions with music integration

### Polymorphism
- `get_points()` - Different implementations for Task and PomodoroTask
- `get_display_info()` - Custom display for each task type
- `to_dict()` / `from_dict()` - Different serialization per class

## Installation & Running

### Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Internet connection (for YouTube music)
- Default browser installed

### Installation Steps

1. Clone or download this project
